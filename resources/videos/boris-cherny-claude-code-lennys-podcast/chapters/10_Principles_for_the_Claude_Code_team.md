## Executive Summary

In this interview segment, the speakers discuss a counter-intuitive management philosophy designed to maximize the utility of Artificial Intelligence (specifically Anthropic's Claude) within an organization. The core argument is that by intentionally "underfunding" projects—assigning fewer human resources than typically required—teams are forced to automate tasks using AI ("Claudify") to bridge the gap. This constraint creates an environment where speed and automation become necessary for survival, rather than just optional enhancements.

The guest argues that this approach taps into an engineer's intrinsic motivation to ship products quickly. Rather than viewing understaffing as a hindrance, it is presented as a catalyst that forces high-leverage behavior. The discussion clarifies that the goal isn't merely cost-cutting; it is about achieving higher performance and velocity by utilizing AI as a force multiplier.

Finally, the guest offers tactical advice for other companies: do not attempt to optimize or cost-cut AI usage (tokens) in the early stages. Instead, companies should provide "unlimited tokens" to engineers as a perk to encourage experimentation. Innovation often looks "crazy" at first, and cost optimization (switching to cheaper models like Haiku or Sonnet) should only occur after an idea has been proven to work.

## Detailed Content

### The "Claudify" Principle [00:00 - 00:21]

**Summary**: The host introduces a specific cultural principle used by the guest's team regarding the preference for AI automation over manual work.

**Key Points**:

- The guest has codified specific principles for their team.
- A core principle is: "What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it."
- This highlights a memory leak in human behavior where we forget to utilize available AI tools.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "I believe one of them is 'What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it.' And it feels like that's exactly what you described with this memory leak... you almost forgot that principle of like, okay, let me see if Claude can solve this for me."

### The Strategy of Underfunding Projects [00:21 - 01:00]

**Summary**: The guest explains how restricting human resources on a project forces the team to rely on AI to meet their goals.

**Key Points**:

- Underfunding projects creates necessary constraints.
- When you only put "one engineer on a project," they are forced to "Claudify" (automate with Claude) to handle the workload.
- Engineers have an intrinsic motivation to ship quickly; they don't need to be forced to do a good job, they just need the tools to execute their ideas faster.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "There's this interesting thing that happens also when you... underfund everything a little bit. Because then people are kind of forced to Claudify... If you have Claude, you can just use that to automate a lot of work."

### The Principle of Speed ("Do It Today") [01:00 - 01:32]

**Summary**: A discussion on the cultural value of immediacy and speed within the organization.

**Key Points**:

- If a task *can* be done today, it *should* be done today.
- This speed was essential early in the company's history when they were small and competing in a crowded market.
- Speed remains a core principle, and using AI is the primary mechanism to achieve that speed.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "If you can do something today, you should just do it today... Early on it was really important because it was just me... our only advantage was speed."

### Re-framing Underfunding [01:32 - 02:00]

**Summary**: The host clarifies that the goal of underfunding is not financial austerity, but rather a forcing function for higher productivity and better outcomes.

**Key Points**:

- The general assumption is that AI leads to fewer employees.
- The nuance here is different: Underfunding is a strategy to get *more* out of the existing team and AI tools.
- It is not just about doing the same work with fewer people, but doing *better* work because the constraint forces the use of superior tooling (AI).

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "It's not only you can be more productive... what you're saying is that you will actually do better if you underfund. It's not just that AI can make you faster, it's [that] you will get more out of the AI tooling if you have fewer people working on something."

### Advice for Leaders: Unlimited Tokens [02:00 - 02:46]

**Summary**: The guest provides strategic advice to CTOs and leaders regarding AI budget management and innovation.

**Key Points**:

- **Don't cost-cut early:** Do not try to optimize token usage at the beginning of AI adoption.
- **Grant access:** Give engineers as many tokens as possible (even treating it as a job perk).
- **Freedom to experiment:** Unlimited access allows people to try "crazy" ideas that might otherwise be stifled by budget concerns.
- **Scale later:** Only worry about model optimization (e.g., switching from Opus to Haiku/Sonnet) after an idea has proven to be effective.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "My advice generally is don't try to optimize, don't try to cost cut at the beginning. Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible... It makes people free to try these ideas that would have been too crazy."

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Host:** ...is very different. And here you have these very specific principles that you've codified for your team. That when people join you, you kind of walk them through them. I believe one of them is: "What's better than doing something? Having Claude do it." And it feels like that's exactly what you described with this memory leak is just like, you almost forgot that principle of like, okay, let me see if Claude can solve this for me.

**[00:21]** **Guest:** There's this interesting thing that happens also when you, um, when you underfund everything a little bit. Uh, because then people are kind of forced to Claudify. And this is something that we see. So, you know, for work where sometimes we just put like one engineer on a project and the way that they're able to ship really quickly—because they want to ship quickly, this is like an intrinsic motivation that comes from within, is just wanting to do a good job. If you have a good idea, you just really want to get it out there. No one has to force you to do that. That comes from you.

**[00:50]** **Guest:** Um, and so if you have Claude, you can just use that to automate a lot of work. Uh, and that's kind of what we see over and over. So I think that's kind of like one principle is underfunding things a little bit. I think another principle is just encouraging people to go faster. So if you *can* do something today, you should just do it today.

**[01:08]** **Guest:** And this is something we really, really encourage on the team. Early on, it was really important because it was just me. And so our only advantage was speed. [Laughs] That's the only way that we could ship a product that would compete in this very crowded coding market. But nowadays it's still a very much a principle we have on the team. And if you want to go faster, a really good way to do that is to just have Claude do more stuff. Um, so it just very much encourages that.

**[01:32]** **Host:** This idea of underfunding... it's so interesting because in general, there's this feeling like AI is gonna allow you to not have as many employees, not have as many engineers. And so it's not only you can be more productive, what you're saying is that you will actually do better if you underfund. It's not just that AI can make you faster, it's you will get more out of the AI tooling if you have fewer people working on something.

**[01:54]** **Guest:** Yeah, if you hire great engineers, they'll figure out how to do it. And especially if you empower them to do it. This is something actually I talk a lot about with, uh, you know, with like CTOs and kind of all sorts of companies. My advice generally is don't try to optimize, don't try to cost cut at the beginning. Start by just giving engineers as many tokens as possible.

**[02:15]** **Guest:** And now you're starting to see companies like, you know, at Anthropic we have, you know, everyone can use a lot of tokens. We're starting to see this come up as like a perk at some companies. Like if you join, you get unlimited tokens. This is a thing I very much encourage because, um, it makes people free to try these ideas that would have been too crazy.

**[02:34]** **Guest:** And then if there's an idea that works, then you can figure out how to scale it. And that's the point to kind of optimize and to cost cut, figure out like, you know, maybe you can do it with Haiku or with Sonnet instead of Opus or whatever. But at the beginning, you just want to throw a lot of tokens at it and see if the idea works.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **Underfunding as a Strategy**: Intentionally allocating fewer human resources to a project creates a constraint that forces teams to adopt AI automation ("Claudify") to meet their goals.
1. **Intrinsic Motivation**: Great engineers want to ship quickly. AI tools align with this intrinsic motivation by removing friction and automating manual work.
1. **Optimization Timing**: Do not optimize for cost (token usage) in the exploration phase. Optimization is for scaling proven ideas, not for initial experimentation.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Audit Project Staffing**: Consider reducing team size on specific projects to see if it drives higher AI adoption and automation.
- [ ] **Implement "Unlimited Tokens"**: Provide engineering teams with uncapped access to AI models as a perk to encourage fearless experimentation.
- [ ] **Adopt the "Do It Today" Mindset**: Challenge teams to ask if a task scheduled for later can be completed today using AI assistance.
- [ ] **Don't Pre-Optimize**: Use the most powerful models (like Opus) for experimentation; switch to cheaper models (Haiku/Sonnet) only after the workflow is proven.
