## Executive Summary

This video serves as a high-production trailer and introduction for an episode of Lenny's Podcast featuring Boris Cherny, the Head of Claude Code at Anthropic. The content opens with a provocative "cold open" montage where Boris asserts that 100% of his code is now written by AI, specifically Claude Code, and that he hasn't manually edited a line of code in months. He describes a massive shift in the industry where engineering productivity has increased by 200% and the role of a "software engineer" is evolving into that of a "product manager" or "builder."

The video uses a narrative device (referencing dates in late 2025 and 2026) to frame the discussion as a look into the near future where AI agents manage the majority of development work. Lenny Rachitsky introduces Boris and highlights the explosive growth of Anthropic and Claude Code, positioning the tool not just as a coding assistant but as a fundamental change to how software is built.

The latter half of the video features detailed sponsorship segments for two developer tools: **DX** (a developer intelligence platform) and **Sentry** (an error tracking and performance monitoring platform), both pitched as essential tools for the AI era of development.

## Detailed Content

### The Shift: 100% AI-Written Code [00:00 - 00:29]

**Summary**: Boris Cherny opens with the startling statistic that he no longer writes code manually. He describes a workflow where he manages multiple AI agents simultaneously to ship pull requests.

**Key Points**:

- Boris claims 100% of his contributions to Claude Code in the last 30 days were written by the AI itself.
- He has not hand-edited a single line since November (contextually implies late 2025 based on on-screen text).
- He ships 10-30 pull requests (PRs) per day by running roughly five AI agents in parallel.
- His enjoyment of coding has peaked because the "minutiae" is removed.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "100% of my code is written by Claude Code. I have not edited a single line by hand since November... Every day I ship 10, 20, 30 pull requests. So I got the moment I have like five agents running while we're recording this?"

**Visual Content**:

### The Rise of the "Product Manager" Engineer [00:40 - 00:55]

**Summary**: Boris predicts a title change for the industry. As the "how" of coding becomes automated, the "what" (product management) becomes the primary skill.

**Key Points**:

- Engineers are effectively becoming Product Managers.
- The title "Software Engineer" will fade away, replaced by "Builder."
- This transition will be painful for those who don't adapt.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

  - Text on screen: "Built for > builders... Work with Claude directly in your codebase... Get Claude Code..."

### Host Introduction & The Growth of Claude Code [00:55 - 02:04]

**Summary**: Lenny Rachitsky formally introduces the episode. He uses a narrative framing device, treating the episode as if it's airing one year after the launch of Claude Code (potentially set in 2026), discussing massive valuation numbers and the tool's impact.

**Key Points**:

- The intro is framed around the "one year anniversary" of Claude Code.
- Mentions Anthropic raising a round at a $380 billion valuation (narrative/speculative figure for the video).
- Highlights that Claude Code's growth is accelerating, doubling daily active users recently.
- Reveals Boris and Lenny were born in the same city in Ukraine.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Boris Cherny**: A hundred percent of my code is written by Claude Code. I have not edited a single line by hand since November. Every day I ship 10, 20, 30 pull requests. So I got the moment I have like five agents running while we're recording this.

**[00:11]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. Do you miss writing code?

**[00:13]** **Boris Cherny**: I have never enjoyed coding as much as I do today because I don't have to deal with all the minutiae. Productivity per engineer has increased 200%.

**[00:21]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: There's always this question, should I learn to code?

**[00:23]** **Boris Cherny**: In a year or two it's not going to matter. Coding is largely solved. I imagine a world where everyone is able to program. Anyone can just build software anytime.

**[00:30]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: What's the next big shift to how software is written?

**[00:32]** **Boris Cherny**: Claude is starting to come up with ideas. Looking through feedback, it's looking at bug reports, it's looking at telemetry for bug fixes and things to ship. A little more like a coworker or something like that.

**[00:41]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: A lot of people listening to this are product managers and... they're probably sweating.

**[00:45]** **Boris Cherny**: I think by the end of the year everyone's going to be a product manager and everyone codes. The title software engineer is going to start to go away. It's just going to be replaced by "Builder" and it's going to be painful for a lot of people.

**[00:55]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: Today my guest is Boris Cherny, Head of Claude Code at Anthropic. It is hard to describe the impact that Claude Code has had on the world. Around the time this episode comes out will be the one year anniversary of Claude Code. And in that short time, it is completely transformed the job of a software engineer. And it is now starting to transform the jobs of many other functions in tech, which we talk about.

**[01:19]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: Claude Code itself is also a massive driver of Anthropic's overall growth over the past year. They just raised a round at over 350 billion dollars. And as Boris mentions, the growth of Claude Code itself is still accelerating. Just in the past month their daily active users has doubled.

**[01:36]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: Boris is also just a really interesting, thoughtful, deep thinking human. And during this conversation, we discover we were born in the same city in Ukraine. That is so funny, I had no idea. A huge thank you to Ben Mann, Jenny Wen, and Mike Krieger for suggesting topics for this conversation. Don't forget to check out lennysproductpass.com for an incredible set of deals available exclusively to Lenny's Newsletter subscribers. Let's get into it after a short word from our wonderful sponsors.

**[02:04]** **Ad Read (Lenny)**: Today's episode is brought to you by DX, the developer intelligence platform designed by leading researchers. To thrive in the AI era, organizations need to adapt quickly. But many organization leaders struggle to answer pressing questions like: Which tools are working? How are they being used? What's actually driving value? DX provides the data and insights that leaders need to navigate this shift.

**[02:27]** **Ad Read (Lenny)**: With DX, companies like Dropbox, Booking.com, Adyen, and Intercom get a deep understanding of how AI is providing value to their developers and what impact AI is having on engineering productivity. To learn more, visit DX's website at getdx.com/lenny. That's getdx.com/lenny.

**[02:48]** **Ad Read (Lenny)**: Applications break in all kinds of ways. Crashes, slowdowns, regressions, and the stuff you only see once real users show up. Sentry catches it all. See what happened, where, and why. Down to the commit that introduced the error, the developer who shipped it, and the exact line of code all in one connected view.

**[03:07]** **Ad Read (Lenny)**: I have definitely tried the five tabs and Slack thread approach to debugging. This is better. Sentry shows you how the request moved, what ran, what slowed down, and what users saw. Seer, Sentry's AI debugging agent, takes it from there. It uses all of that Sentry context to tell you the root cause, suggest a fix, and even opens a PR for you. It also reviews your PRs and flags any breaking changes with fixes ready to go. Try Sentry and Seer for free at sentry.io/lenny and use code LENNY for $100 in Sentry credits. That's sentry.io/lenny.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **Coding is "Solved"**: The manual act of writing syntax is no longer the primary value driver for engineers. AI can now handle 100% of the coding execution.
1. **The Rise of the "Builder"**: The distinction between "Product Manager" and "Software Engineer" is collapsing. The future role is a "Builder" who focuses on *what* to build (PM skills) while AI handles *how* to build it (coding skills).
1. **Agentic Workflows**: The future of productivity isn't just a chatbot; it's running multiple autonomous agents in parallel to handle tasks like bug fixing, feature implementation, and PR management.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Shift Focus to Product Strategy**: Engineers should start cultivating product management skills, as technical implementation will become automated.
- [ ] **Adopt Agent-Based Tools**: Move beyond simple auto-complete to tools that can act as "coworkers" (e.g., Claude Code, Sentry's Seer).
- [ ] **Measure AI Impact**: Organizations need to actively measure how AI tools affect productivity (using tools like DX) rather than just assuming value.
