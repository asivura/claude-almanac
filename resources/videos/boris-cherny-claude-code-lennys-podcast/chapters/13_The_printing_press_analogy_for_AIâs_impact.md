## Executive Summary

In this segment from Lenny's Podcast, Scott Wu (CEO of Cognition AI) discusses the rapidly changing landscape of software engineering in the age of AI. The central question addressed is whether learning to code is still necessary given the capabilities of AI agents. Wu argues that while understanding the underlying technology is currently beneficial for using agents effectively, this requirement will likely vanish within one to two years as the technology matures.

Wu introduces a compelling historical analogy to contextualize the current AI revolution: the invention of the printing press. He draws parallels between modern software engineers and medieval scribes. Just as scribes were a tiny, elite fraction of the population who feared—then embraced—the printing press for removing the tedium of copying, today's engineers are seeing the removal of tedious implementation details (syntax, library management) to focus on higher-level creativity and architecture.

The discussion concludes with the concept of democratization. Both speakers agree that AI is lowering the barrier to entry, allowing non-technical individuals to build complex software and enabling experienced engineers to work in languages or frameworks they don't explicitly know, simply by directing the AI to handle the implementation.

## Detailed Content

### To Code or Not to Code? [00:00 - 00:26]

**Summary**: The host asks the perennial question of whether people should still learn to code. Scott Wu suggests that while it is currently helpful to understand the "layer under" the AI agents, this necessity is fleeting and will likely become irrelevant within a couple of years.

**Key Points**:

- The common question: "Should I learn to code?"
- Current state: Understanding code helps in guiding AI agents.
- Future prediction: In 1-2 years, deep technical coding knowledge will not matter for building software.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> **Host**: "There's always this question: Should I learn to code? Should people in school learn to code? ... Your take is, in like a year or two, you don't really need to."
> **Guest**: "In a year or two, it's not going to matter."

### The Historical Analogy: The Printing Press [00:26 - 01:50]

**Summary**: Wu searches for a historical mental model to explain the AI transition and settles on the printing press. He describes Europe in the mid-1400s where literacy was sub-1% and "scribes" were the exclusive keepers of reading and writing, employed by elites who were often illiterate themselves.

**Key Points**:

- The best historical analog for AI coding is the Printing Press.
- **Pre-Press context**: Mid-1400s Europe had \<1% literacy.
- **The Role of Scribes**: They were the only ones who could write, employed by Kings/Lords to handle information.
- **Impact of the Press**: In the 50 years following the press's invention, more printed material was created than in the previous 1,000 years combined.
- **Cost**: The cost of producing books dropped by ~100x.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "In the 50 years after the printing press was built, there was more printed material created than in the thousand years before."

### The Scribe's Perspective vs. The Engineer's Perspective [01:50 - 02:53]

**Summary**: Wu shares a specific historical anecdote about a scribe interviewed in the 1400s. Contrary to the fear of obsolescence, the scribe was relieved. They enjoyed the art and binding of books but hated the tedious copying of text. Wu parallels this to modern engineering: he enjoys building products and solving user problems, but dislikes the tedium of syntax, git, and toolchains.

**Key Points**:

- **Literacy Rates**: Took time to rise because it required education/free time (not working on farms).
- **Scribe Reaction**: They were excited to stop the "tedious" part (copying text) and focus on the "art" (illustrations/binding).
- **Engineer Parallel**: Engineers often dislike the "tedious" work (Git, dependencies, syntax) but love the "creative" work (figuring out what to build, system architecture).

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "The thing that I don't like doing is copying between books. The thing that I do like doing is drawing the art in books... and I'm really glad that now my time is freed up."

### Democratization of Building Software [02:53 - 03:44]

**Summary**: The host highlights how this shift allows anyone, regardless of technical background, to build software. He shares his own experience of using AI to get unblocked on projects. Wu reinforces this with a story about an engineer who built a working service in the "Go" programming language despite not knowing the language at all.

**Key Points**:

- **Access**: People with no technical experience can now build what they envision.
- **Unblocking**: AI moves the workflow from "stuck on libraries/dependencies" to "step-by-step execution."
- **Language Agnosticism**: Engineers can now work across languages they don't know (e.g., writing a service in Go without knowing Go).

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> **Host**: "What's amazing is that the tool you're building allows anybody to do this... 'Help me figure this out.' And you get unblocked."
> **Guest**: "He built out the service, it's working quite well... and he was like, 'You know, like, I still don't really know Go.'"

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Host**: So, what I'm hearing here is in terms of—there's always this question: Should I learn to code? Should people in school learn to code? Uh, what I heard from you is, your take is, in like a year or two, you don't really need to.

**[00:10]** **Guest**: My take is, I think for—for people that are using, um, that are using LLM code, that are using agents to code today, you still have to understand the layer under. But yeah, in a year or two it's not going to matter. I—I was thinking about, um, what is the right, like, historical analogue for this? Because, you know, like somehow we have to situate this thing in history and—and kind of figure out when have we gone through similar transitions? What's the right kind of mental model for this?

**[00:40]** **Guest**: I think the thing that's come closest for me is the printing press. And so, you know, if you look at Europe in, uh, you know, like in the—in the mid-1400s, literacy was actually very low. Uh, there was sub-one percent of that population, it was scribes, that, uh, you know, they were the ones that did all the writing. They—they were the ones that did all the reading. They were employed by, like, lords and kings that often were not literate themselves. And so, you know, it was their job of this very tiny percent of the population to do this.

**[01:14]** **Guest**: And at some point, the, you know, Gutenberg and—and the printing press came along. And there—there was this crazy stat that in the 50 years after the printing press was, uh, built, there was more printed material created than in the cen—in the thousand years before. And so the—the volume of printed material just went way up. Uh, the cost went way down. It went down something like a hundred X over the next 50 years.

**[01:42]** **Guest**: And if you look at literacy, you know, oh, it actually took a while because learning to read and write is, you know, it's quite hard. It takes an education system. It takes free time. You—it takes like not having to work on a farm all day so that you actually have time for education and things like this. But over the next 200 years, it went up to like 70% globally. So, I think this is the kind of thing that we might see, is a similar kind of transition.

**[01:52]** **Guest**: And there was, uh, there was actually this interesting, um, historical document where there was an interview with some, like, scribe in the 1400s about like, how do you feel a—about the printing press? And they were actually very excited because they were like, "Actually, the thing that I don't like doing is copying between books. The thing that I do like doing is drawing the art in books and then doing the bookbinding. And I'm really glad that now my time is freed up."

**[02:35]** **Guest**: And it—it's interesting, like, as an engineer, I sort of felt like a parallel with this. Like, this is sort of how I feel. Where I don't have to do the tedious work anymore of coding. Because this has always been sort of the detail of it. It's always been the tedious part of it. And kind of like messing with, like, Git and using all these different tools. That—that was not the fun part. The fun part is figuring out what to build and kin—coming up with this. It's, uh, it's talking to users. It's thinking about these big systems. It's thinking about the future. It's collaborating with, you know, other people on the team. And that—that's what I get to do more of now.

**[02:53]** **Host**: And what's amazing is that the tool you're building allows anybody to do this. People that have no technical experience can do exactly what you're describing. Like I've—I've been doing a bunch of random little projects and it's just like, anytime you get stuck, just like, "Help me figure this out." And you get unblocked. Like I used to—I was an engineer for, earlier in my career for 10 years, and I just remember spending so much time on like libraries and dependencies and little things and just like, "Oh my god, what do I do?" And then looking on Stack Overflow. And now it's just like, "Help me figure this out." And here is step one, step one, two, three, four. Okay, we got this.

**[03:22]** **Guest**: Yeah, exactly, exactly. I was talking to an engineer earlier today. They're like, they're writing some service in Go. And, you know, it's been like a month already and they—they built out the service. Like it—it's working quite well. And then I was like, "Okay, so like, how do you feel writing it?" He was like, "You know, like I—I still don't really know Go. But..." [Laughs] And I—I think we're going to start to see more and more of this. It's like, if you know that it works correctly and efficiently, then you—you don't know the...

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **Coding Syntax is the New "Copying"**: Just as scribes moved from copying text to creating art, engineers are moving from writing syntax to designing systems and products.
1. **The 1-2 Year Horizon**: While technical knowledge helps today to "supervise" AI agents, within 1-2 years, the need to know the underlying code layers will likely disappear.
1. **Volume and Cost Revolution**: Similar to the printing press (100x cost reduction, massive volume increase), AI will drastically lower the cost of software creation and explode the volume of software built.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Focus on Architecture over Syntax**: If you are learning to code, focus on system design, product needs, and architecture rather than memorizing syntax, as AI will handle the implementation.
- [ ] **Don't Let Language Barriers Stop You**: Use AI agents to build in languages or frameworks you don't know (e.g., Go, Rust) by focusing on the logic and letting the AI handle the syntax.
- [ ] **Embrace the "Scribe" Transition**: Identify the "tedious" parts of your current workflow (git, configuration, boilerplate) and actively use AI to automate them so you can focus on user problems.
