# Executive Summary

In this segment from Lenny's Podcast, host Lenny Rachitsky and Anthropic's Alex Albert discuss the rapid and transformative adoption of "Claude Code" in the software development industry. The conversation centers around the one-year anniversary of the tool, highlighting staggering statistics from a recent SemiAnalysis report which reveals that 4% of all public GitHub commits are now authored by Claude Code, with projections estimating this will rise to 20% by the end of the year.

The discussion moves beyond simple code generation to the shifting role of senior engineers. Lenny cites examples, such as Spotify, where top developers are no longer writing lines of code manually, but rather orchestrating AI to do the work. Alex Albert confirms this trend, noting that for many advanced engineers, the act of typing code is becoming obsolete.

Finally, Albert provides insight into Anthropic's strategic "mental model" for AI development. He explains the progression from **Coding** to **Tool Use** to **Computer Use**. He emphasizes that this evolution—where AI transitions from a conversation partner to an agent that acts in the world (checking email, using Slack, coding)—is critical not just for utility, but for AI safety, as the systems become more capable and autonomous.

# Detailed Content

### Introduction & The SemiAnalysis Report [00:00 - 00:41]

**Summary**: Lenny introduces the topic by referencing a SemiAnalysis report that quantifies the massive impact of Claude Code on GitHub activity.

**Key Points**:

- The podcast episode coincides with the one-year anniversary of launching Claude Code.
- A SemiAnalysis report states 4% of all public GitHub commits are currently authored by Claude Code.
- The prediction is that AI will generate 20%+ of all daily commits by the end of 2026.
- The report suggests AI has "consumed all of software development" while the industry blinked.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "There's um, this report that recently came out that I'm sure you saw by SemiAnalysis that showed that 4% of all GitHub commits are authored by Claude Code now... The way they put it is, 'While we blinked, AI consumed all of software development.'"

**Visual Content**:

### The Shift in Senior Engineering Roles [00:27 - 00:41]

**Summary**: Lenny discusses how AI is changing the day-to-day work of senior developers, citing Spotify as a prime example.

**Key Points**:

- Spotify reported that their best developers haven't written manual code since December due to AI.
- Advanced engineers are increasingly sharing that they no longer write code; some don't even *look* at code anymore.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Spotify just put out this uh, headline that their best developers haven't written a line of code since December, thanks to AI. More and more of the most advanced senior engineers including you are sharing the fact that you don't write code anymore..."

  - **Text on screen**: "Spotify says its best developers haven't written a line of code since December, thanks to AI"

### Alex Albert's Reaction & Anthropic's Strategy [00:42 - 01:29]

**Summary**: Alex Albert validates the statistics, suggesting the real numbers (including private repos) are likely higher. He outlines Anthropic's development philosophy, moving from coding proficiency to general computer use.

**Key Points**:

- The 4% figure is likely an underestimation because it only counts public commits; private repository usage is higher.
- The growth rate of Claude Code is accelerating, not just growing linearly.
- Claude Code started as a hack within the "Anthropic Labs" team.
- **Anthropic's Mental Model**:
  1. Model gets good at **Coding**.
  1. Model gets good at **Tool Use**.
  1. Model gets good at **Computer Use**.
- This progression is crucial for AI Safety research because it involves AI *acting* in the real world, not just chatting.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "These numbers are just totally crazy right? Like 4% of all commits in the world is just way more than I imagined... For Anthropic for a long time, we were building the models in this way that kind of fit our mental model... where the model starts by being really good at coding, then it gets really good at tool use, then it gets really good at computer use."

# Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Lenny**: Okay, so let me follow the thread of just coming back to Anthropic and the work you've done there. This podcast is going to come out around the year anniversary of launching Claude Code. So I want to spend a little time just reflecting on the impact that you've had. There's, um, this report that recently came out that I'm sure you saw by SemiAnalysis that showed that 4% of all GitHub commits are authored by Claude Code now.

**[00:19]** **Lenny**: And they predicted it'll be a fifth of all code commits on GitHub by the end of the year. The way they put it is, "While we blinked, AI consumed all of software development." The day that we're recording this, Spotify just put out this, uh, headline that their best developers haven't written a line of code since December, thanks to AI.

**[00:38]** **Lenny**: More and more of the most advanced senior engineers, including you, are sharing the fact that you don't write code anymore, that it's all AI generated, and many aren't even looking at code anymore is how far we've gotten. In large part thanks to this little project that you started and that your team has scaled over the past year. I'm curious just to hear your reflections on this past year and the impact that your work has had.

**[00:59]** **Alex**: These numbers are just totally crazy, right? Like 4%... 4% of all commits in the world is just way more than I imagined. And like you said, it still feels like the starting point. Um, these are also just public commits. So we actually think if you look at private repositories, it's quite a bit higher than that. And I think the craziest thing for me isn't even the number that we're at right now, but the pace at which we're growing.

**[01:21]** **Alex**: Because if you look at Claude Code's growth rate kind of across any metric, it's continuing to accelerate. Um, so it's not just going up, it's going up faster and faster. When I first started Claude Code, it was just going to be a little hack. Um, you know, we broadly knew at Anthropic that we wanted to ship some kind of coding product.

**[01:40]** **Alex**: And, you know, for Anthropic for a long time, we were building the models in this way that kind of fit our mental model of the way that we build safe AGI. Where the model starts by being really good at coding, then it gets really good at tool use, then it gets really good at computer use. Roughly, this is like the trajectory.

**[01:56]** **Alex**: Uh, and you know, we've been working on this for a long time. And when you look at the team that I started on, it was called the Anthropic Labs team. Uh, and actually Mike Krieger and, you know, Ben Mann, they just kicked this team off again, uh, for kind of round two. The team built some pretty cool stuff. So we built Claude Code, we built MCP, we built the desktop app.

**[02:16]** **Alex**: So you can kind of see the seeds of this idea. You know, like it's coding, then it's tool use, then it's computer use. And the reason this matters for Anthropic is, uh, because of safety. It's kind of again, just back to that. AI is getting more and more powerful, it's getting more and more capable. The thing that's happened in the last year is that for at least for engineers, the AI doesn't just write the code, it's not just a conversation partner, but it actually uses tools. It acts in the world.

**[02:41]** **Alex**: Um, and I think now with Cowork, we're starting to see the transition for non-technical folks also. Um, for a lot of people that use conversational AI, this might be the first time that they're using a thing that actually acts. It can actually use your Gmail, it can use your Slack. You can do all these things for you and it's quite good at it. Um, and it's only going to get better.

# Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **AI Code Generation is Mainstream**: With 4% of public GitHub commits (and likely higher in private repos) being authored by Claude Code, AI is no longer a niche tool but a fundamental driver of software development volume.
1. **The Acceleration of AI Capabilities**: The growth of these tools is not linear; it is accelerating. The progression follows a specific path: mastering coding logic -> mastering tool usage -> mastering general computer usage.
1. **The Shift from "Conversation" to "Action"**: The true inflection point is AI moving from a chatbot (informational) to an agent (action-oriented). It can now use Gmail, Slack, and development environments to perform tasks independently, which has massive implications for both productivity and safety.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **For Developers**: Accept that manual coding is decreasing. Shift focus to orchestrating AI agents, reviewing architecture, and managing "Tool Use."
- [ ] **For Non-Technical Users**: Prepare for "Cowork" style AI agents that will soon be able to operate your email, Slack, and other desktop apps, moving beyond simple Q&A.
- [ ] **For Organizations**: Recognize that "Computer Use" is the next frontier. Investigate how AI agents can interact with your internal tools (via protocols like MCP - Model Context Protocol) rather than just generating text.
