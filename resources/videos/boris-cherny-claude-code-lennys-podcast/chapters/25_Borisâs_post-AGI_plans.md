## Executive Summary

In this segment of Lenny's Podcast, the host poses a question sourced from Ben Mann (Co-founder of Anthropic) to the guest: "What is your plan post-AGI?" (Artificial General Intelligence). The discussion serves as a reflection on the contrast between the hyper-fast pace of modern AI engineering and the slow, deliberate rhythms of traditional life.

The guest answers by recounting his time living in rural Japan before joining Anthropic. He describes a lifestyle defined by community connection through bartering food (specifically pickles) and the art of making miso. He draws a philosophical distinction between software engineering and fermentation; while engineering is often about speed and iteration, making miso requires patience and thinking on time scales of months to years.

The video concludes with the realization that in a post-AGI world, where human intellectual labor might be less central, the guest would return to these tangible, slow, and patience-driven crafts. The segment highlights a desire for grounding and physical creation as a counterbalance to high-level digital abstraction.

## Detailed Content

### The "Post-AGI" Question [00:00 - 00:15]

**Summary**: Lenny introduces a question suggested by Ben Mann, specifically asking what the guest intends to do with his life once Artificial General Intelligence is achieved.

**Key Points**:

- The question was crowdsourced from Ben Mann (Anthropic Co-founder).
- The topic is speculative: "Post-AGI" life.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Maybe a last question... I talked to Ben Mann, co-founder of Anthropic... One question he had for you is: What's your plan post-AGI? What do you think you're going to be doing with your life once we hit AGI, whatever that means?"

  - **Right**: Guest wearing a dark hoodie and white earbuds. Plain white background.

### Life in Rural Japan [00:15 - 00:40]

**Summary**: The guest contextualizes his answer by describing his lifestyle prior to joining Anthropic, where he lived in isolation in rural Japan.

**Key Points**:

- He lived in rural Japan before joining the AI lab.
- He was the only engineer and English speaker in town.
- Life was slower: Biking to farmers markets, riding by rice paddies.
- The vibe was the "complete opposite of San Francisco."

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Before I joined Anthropic, I was actually living in rural Japan... it was like a totally different lifestyle. I was like the only engineer in the town, I was the only English speaker in the town... Just a totally different vibe."

### The Economy of Pickles [00:40 - 00:58]

**Summary**: The guest explains how he integrated into the local community not through technology, but through the traditional practice of making and trading food.

**Key Points**:

- Community building was done by trading pickles.
- Everyone in the town made miso and pickles.
- The guest learned these skills to fit in.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "One of the things that I really liked is a way that we got to know our neighbors and we kind of built friendships is by trading like, pickles. So in that town where we lived... everyone made miso, everyone made pickles."

### The Philosophy of Miso vs. Engineering [00:58 - 01:14]

**Summary**: The guest deep dives into the technical and philosophical aspects of making miso, contrasting the extreme patience required for fermentation with the mindset of software engineering.

**Key Points**:

- **Miso vs. Engineering**: Miso teaches long-time-scale thinking; engineering is often about immediate feedback.
- **Patience**:
  - White Miso: ~3 months.
  - Red Miso: 2, 3, or 4 years.
- **Process**: You mix it up and simply let it sit. You cannot rush it.
- **Conclusion**: Post-AGI, he would return to making miso.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Miso is this interesting thing where it teaches you to think on these long time scales. That's just very different than engineering... A batch of white miso takes like at least 3 months to make. And a red miso is like, you know, 2, 3, 4 years. You just have to be very patient."

## All Visual Content with Speaker Notes

### Visual 1 - Split Screen Interview [00:00 - 01:14]

- **Type**: Live Video Feed (Podcast Format)
- **Content**:
  - **Host (Left)**: Animated, smiling, leaning into the microphone.
  - **Guest (Right)**: Calm demeanor, speaking thoughtfully, smiling when recalling the memories.
- **Text on Screen**: None (other than the logo in top right).
- **Speaker Notes**:
  - The visual remains static throughout the clip. The primary visual cue is the contrast in energy; the host is inquisitive and amused, while the guest becomes increasingly nostalgic and peaceful as he describes the slow process of fermentation.
  - At **01:12**, both speakers laugh as the host reveals that Ben Mann's question was specifically a prompt to get the guest to talk about his miso obsession ("What's the deal with you and miso?").

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Host**: Maybe a last question. So I talked to Ben Mann, co-founder of Anthropic. What— what to talk to you about. He had a bunch of suggestions which I've integrated throughout our chat. One question he had for you is: What's your plan post-AGI? What do you think you're going to be doing, what's your life like once we hit AGI, whatever that means?

**[00:15]** **Guest**: So, before I joined Anthropic, um, I was actually living in rural Japan and it was like a totally different lifestyle. Um, I was like the only engineer in the town, I was the only English speaker in the town. It was just like a totally different vibe. Like, a couple of times a week I would like bike to the farmers market. Uh, and, you know, you like bike by like rice paddies and stuff. It was just like a totally different speed then... just complete opposite of San Francisco.

**[00:41]** **Guest**: One of the things that I really liked is a way that we got to know our neighbors and we kind of built friendships is by trading like, pickles. So, in that— in the town where we lived, it was actually like everyone made like miso, everyone made pickles. Uh, and so I actually got like decently good at making miso. Um, and you know, I made a bunch of batches and, um, this is something that I still make.

**[00:58]** **Guest**: Uh, miso is this interesting thing where it teaches you to think on these long time scales. That's just very different than engineering. Cause like a— you know, like a batch of white miso takes like at least three months to make. And a red miso is like, you know, two, three, four years. You just have to be very patient. You kind of mix it up and then you just like let it sit. You have to be very, very patient.

**[01:10]** **Guest**: So I— the thing that I love about it is just thinking in these long time scales. Uh, and yeah, I think post-AGI, or if I wasn't at Anthropic, I'd probably be making miso.

**[01:12]** **Host**: [Laughing] I love this answer. Uh, Ben asked me to ask you about "What's the deal with you and miso?" and uh, so I love that you... answered it.

**[01:13]** **Guest**: [Laughing]

**[01:13]** **Host**: Okay so the future... the future might be just going deep into miso. Getting— getting really good at getting making miso.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **The Value of Long Time Scales**: In a world optimized for speed (engineering, AI development), there is unique value in processes that cannot be rushed, such as fermentation (2-4 years for red miso).
1. **Community via Craft**: Connection with others can be forged through the exchange of handmade goods (trading pickles) rather than shared language or professional background.
1. **Post-AGI Purpose**: When high-level cognitive tasks are potentially automated by AGI, humans may find meaning in returning to physical, slow, and patience-based crafts.
