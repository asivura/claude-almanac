## Executive Summary

In this segment of Lenny's Podcast, host Lenny Rachitsky interviews Boris Power regarding a peculiar and rapid sequence of career moves that occurred approximately six months prior. The discussion centers on Boris's decision to leave Anthropic to join the AI coding startup Cursor, only to return to Anthropic just two weeks later.

The core of the video explores the tension between product excitement and mission alignment. Boris explains that while he was incredibly impressed by the Cursor team and their product vision, he quickly realized that "building a cool product" was not a substitute for the deep, safety-oriented mission that drives Anthropic.

Key conclusions from this interview highlight the importance of self-awareness in professional life. Boris articulates that for him to be truly happy and fulfilled, he requires a high-stakes mission—specifically the safety of artificial intelligence—rather than just technical innovation. This insight offers a look into the internal culture of Anthropic, where "safety" is the unifying motivator for the staff.

### The Appeal of Cursor [00:27 - 00:46]

**Key Points**:

### The Realization: Missing the Mission [00:46 - 01:31]

**Key Points**:

- Boris previously worked in Big Tech but wanted to work at a lab to "shape the future."
- The specific driver for him at Anthropic is **Safety**.
- He realized that without that specific mission, he felt a void.

**Key Points**:

- If you ask anyone at Anthropic why they are there, the answer is "Safety."
- Building cool products is not a substitute for a mission-driven existence for Boris.
- He returned because he needed that alignment to be happy.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "When you talk to people at Anthropic... find someone in the hallway, if you ask them why they're there, the answer is always going to be safety." - Boris Power

**[00:04]** **Lenny**: Boris, thank you so much for being here. And welcome to the podcast.

**[00:08]** **Boris**: Yeah, thanks for having me on.

**[00:10]** **Lenny**: I want to start with a, a spicy question. About six months ago, I don't know if people even remember this, you actually left Anthropic, you joined Cursor, and then two weeks later you went back to Anthropic. What happened there? I don't think I've ever heard the actual story.

**[00:27]** **Boris**: (Laughs) It's the fastest job change that I've ever had. Um, I joined Cursor because I'm a big fan of the product. And honestly, I met the team and I was just really impressed. Uh, they're an awesome team. Uh, I still, I still think they're awesome and they're just building really cool stuff.

**[00:46]** **Boris**: And kind of they, they saw where AI coding was going I think before a lot of people did. So the, the idea of building good product was just very exciting for me. I think as soon as I got there what I started to realize is what I really missed about Ant [Anthropic] was the mission. And that's actually what originally drove me to Ant also.

**[01:06]** **Boris**: Because, uh, before I joined Anthropic I was, you know, I was working in Big Tech and then I was, at some point I wanted to work at a, at a lab to just help shape the future of this crazy thing that, that we're building in some way.

**[01:19]** **Boris**: And the thing that drew me to Anthropic was the mission. And it was, you know, it's all about safety. And when you talk to people at Anthropic, just like find someone in the hallway, if you ask them why they're there, the answer is always going to be safety.

**[01:31]** **Boris**: Um, and so this kind of like mission-drivenness just really, really resonated with me. And I just know personally it's something I need in order to be happy. Um, and I just, that's just the thing that I really missed. And I found that, you know, whatever the work might be, no matter how exciting, even if it's building a really cool product, it's just not really a substitute for that.

**[01:53]** **Boris**: Um, so for me it was actually uh, it was pretty obvious that, that I was missing that pretty quickly.

**[02:08]** (End of video)

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **Mission Alignment is Critical for Retention**: For some top-tier talent, the excitement of a product or a great team is not enough to sustain them if the underlying "mission" (the *why*) is missing.
1. **Corporate Identity**: Anthropic has successfully cultivated a monolithic culture where "Safety" is the universal answer to why employees work there. This clarity helps attract and retain specific types of talent.
1. **Self-Knowledge in Career**: Boris demonstrated high self-awareness by recognizing quickly (within two weeks) that he had made a mismatch in his career values and correcting it immediately rather than waiting.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Evaluate your "Why"**: Before changing jobs, assess if you are driven more by the *product* you are building or the *mission* you are serving.
- [ ] **Test Company Culture**: When interviewing, ask random employees why they work there. If the answers align (like Anthropic's "Safety"), the culture is strong.
