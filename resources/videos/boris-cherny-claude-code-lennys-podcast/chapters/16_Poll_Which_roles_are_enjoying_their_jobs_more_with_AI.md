## Executive Summary

This video clip features a discussion between host Lenny Rachitsky and a guest from Anthropic regarding the shifting landscape of job satisfaction in the tech industry due to the adoption of Artificial Intelligence tools. The conversation is anchored by an informal survey conducted by Rachitsky on Twitter, which polled Product Managers, Engineers, and Designers on whether AI has made their jobs more or less enjoyable.

The core finding presented is a significant disparity between roles: while approximately 70% of Engineers and Product Managers report enjoying their jobs more, only 55% of Designers share that sentiment, with a notable 20% enjoying it less. The speakers explore the reasons behind this, suggesting that "unblocking" is a key factor.

The guest provides insight from his experience at Anthropic, noting that technical proficiency allows employees to use AI to bypass obstacles and code solutions themselves, regardless of their official job title. The conclusion is that AI acts as a force multiplier for those with technical inclination, allowing them to build and create more freely, whereas those without those skills (or in roles where AI output is less deterministic, like design) may feel differently.

## Detailed Content

### The Survey: AI's Impact on Tech Roles [00:00 - 01:11]

**Summary**: Lenny introduces an informal survey he conducted across three major tech roles (Engineers, PMs, and Designers) to gauge sentiment regarding AI adoption.

**Key Points**:

- Lenny conducted three separate polls on Twitter.
- **Engineers & PMs**: High satisfaction increase (~70% enjoy jobs more; ~10% enjoy jobs less).
- **Designers**: Lower satisfaction increase (~55% enjoy jobs more; ~20% enjoy jobs less).
- There is a clear statistical gap between how designers perceive AI tools versus how builders/managers perceive them.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "I asked engineers, 'Are you enjoying your job more or less since adopting AI tools?' ... Both engineers and PMs, 70% of people said they are enjoying their job more... Designers, interestingly, only 55% said they are enjoying their job more and 20% said they are enjoying their job less."

  - Text: "I called PMs, engineers, and designers asking if they are enjoying their jobs more or less with the rise of AI."
  - **Key Data (Visible in graphic):**
    - **Engineers**: Enjoying it more: **70.1%** | Enjoying it less: **10.6%**
    - **PMs**: Enjoying it more: **70.2%** | Enjoying it less: **10.6%**
    - **Designers**: Enjoying it more: **55.4%** | Enjoying it less: **19.8%**

### The "Unblocking" Effect at Anthropic [01:12 - 01:52]

**Summary**: The guest reflects on the data, expressing a desire to understand the "less enjoyable" cohort. He shares his observations from working at Anthropic, suggesting that technical skills combined with AI allow for greater autonomy and satisfaction.

**Key Points**:

- At Anthropic, there is a high bar for technical literacy across all roles, not just engineering.
- Designers who code are finding high satisfaction because AI helps them "unblock" themselves and build prototypes without waiting for engineers.
- Even designers who didn't code previously are starting to do so to leverage these tools.
- The ability to self-serve and build appears to be a major driver of joy in the AI era.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "I am seeing this a little bit with Anthropic... everyone is fairly technical... our designers largely code. So I think for them, this is something that they have enjoyed... because now instead of bugging engineers, they can just go in and code."

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **(Visual: Metaview Title Card)**

**[00:06]** **Lenny Rachitsky**: You talked about how you're enjoying coding more. I actually did this little informal survey on Twitter, I don't know if you saw this, where I just asked... I did three different polls. I asked Engineers, "Are you enjoying your job more or less since adopting AI tools?" And then I did a separate one for PMs and one for Designers.

**[00:26]** **Lenny**: And both Engineers and PMs... 70% of people said they are enjoying their job *more*. And about 10% said they're enjoying their job *less*.

**[00:38]** **Lenny**: Designers, interestingly... only 55% said they are enjoying their job more, and 20% said they are enjoying their job less. I thought that was really interesting.

**[00:51]** **Guest**: That's super interesting. I'd love to talk to these people. You know, both in the 'more' bucket and the 'less' bucket just to understand. Did you get to follow up with any of them?

**[01:00]** **Lenny**: A few people replied. I'm actually doing a follow-up poll that we'll link to in the show notes of going deeper into some of this stuff. But a lot of... there's like, you know, the factors that make it more fun and less fun. The designers, they didn't share a lot actually. I just... like the people that... actually asked just like, "Why are you enjoying your job less?" And I didn't hear a lot. So I'm curious what's going on there.

**[01:18]** **Guest**: Yeah, I am seeing this a little bit with... uh... Anthropic. I think everyone is fairly technical. This is something that we screen for, you know, when people join. We have... there's a lot of technical interviews that people go through, even for non-technical functions.

**[01:34]** **Guest**: Uh, and you know, our designers largely code. So I think for them, this is something that they have enjoyed from what I've seen, because now instead of bugging engineers, they can just go in and code.

**[01:48]** **Guest**: And even some designers that didn't code before have just started to do it. And for them it's great because they can unblock themselves. But I'd be really interested just to hear more people's experiences because I bet it's not uniform like that.

**[01:59]** **Lenny**: Yeah, so maybe if you're listening to this, leave a comment if you're finding your jobs less fun. And you're enjoying your job less. Because what you're saying and what I'm hearing from most people... 70% of PMs and engineers are loving their job *more*. That's... like if you're not in that bucket... you could... something's going on there.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **AI Enhances Satisfaction for "Builders"**: Engineers and Product Managers are overwhelmingly (70%) finding their work more enjoyable with AI tools, likely because it removes drudgery and accelerates output.
1. **The Designer Disconnect**: Designers are statistically less likely to enjoy the shift to AI (55% positive vs 70% for others) and twice as likely to enjoy it less (20% vs 10%). This suggests current AI workflows may disrupt the creative design process differently than the engineering process.
1. **Technical Skills = Autonomy**: At companies like Anthropic, where technical literacy is screened for across all roles, AI tools serve as "unblockers." This allows non-engineers (like designers) to build and code solutions themselves, increasing their job satisfaction by reducing dependency on others.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **For Designers**: Consider learning basic coding skills. The data suggests that designers who can "unblock" themselves using code + AI are finding more joy in their work than those who cannot.
- [ ] **For Hiring Managers**: Consider screening for technical aptitude even in non-technical roles. Employees who can leverage AI to build their own tools or prototypes are more autonomous and satisfied.
- [ ] **For Listeners**: If you are in the minority finding your job *less* fun due to AI, analyze why. Is it a lack of technical leverage, or a change in the nature of the work?
