## Executive Summary

In this segment from Lenny's Podcast, the discussion centers on the rapid evolution of AI in software engineering, specifically focusing on Anthropic's "Claude Code." The host, Lenny Rachitsky, posits that AI writing code is now the standard, prompting a discussion on what lies beyond mere code generation.

The guest (an engineering leader from Anthropic) argues that **coding is largely a "solved problem"** for their team. The next frontier involves AI agents acting as proactive coworkers—monitoring telemetry to suggest bug fixes, managing project boards, syncing spreadsheets, and handling administrative overhead. A key workflow described involves pointing Claude at internal feedback channels (e.g., Slack) to automatically generate Pull Requests (PRs) for issues mentioned by staff, creating a hyper-efficient feedback loop.

The conversation concludes with staggering statistics: since implementing these workflows, Anthropic's engineering team has reportedly seen a **4x increase in overall output** and a **200% increase in productivity per engineer**. The guest contrasts this with his previous experience at Meta, where a few percentage points of productivity gain were considered significant.

## Detailed Content

### The Next Frontier: Beyond Code Generation [00:00 - 00:25]

**Summary**: Lenny sets the stage by acknowledging that AI writing code is now the norm ("100% of your code is being written by AI"). He asks what the next major shift in software engineering will be.

**Key Points**:

- AI writing code is now considered the baseline standard.
- The industry is looking for the next "crazy milestone."

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "At this point, 100% of your code is being written by AI... What's kind of the next frontier? ... What's kind of the next big shift to how software is written?"

### Claude as an Idea Generator & Project Manager [00:26 - 01:42]

**Summary**: The guest explains that Claude is evolving from a passive tool to a proactive agent. It is now capable of looking at raw data (telemetry, bug reports) and suggesting ideas or fixes autonomously.

**Key Points**:

- **Idea Generation**: Claude reviews feedback and telemetry to propose bug fixes without human prompting.
- **"Coding is Solved"**: The guest claims coding is a solved problem for the type of programming they do.
- **Beyond Coding**: Claude is being used for "coworker" tasks: paying parking tickets, project management, syncing data between spreadsheets and Slack.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Claude is starting to come up with ideas. So Claude is looking through feedback, it's looking at bug reports, it's looking at telemetry... and it's starting to come up with ideas for bug fixes and things to ship."
> "I think at this point it's safe to say that coding is largely solved."

### Workflow: From Slack Feedback to Auto-PRs [01:43 - 03:33]

**Summary**: Lenny asks for specific tactics on how to use Claude to decide *what* to build. The guest describes a workflow involving an internal "Claude Code" feedback channel on Slack.

**Key Points**:

- **The "Black Hole" Problem**: Usually, product feedback goes into a void, discouraging users.
- **The Solution**: Pointing Claude at a feedback Slack thread allows it to read the issue and generate a Pull Request (PR) instantly.
- **Psychological Impact**: Rapid fixes (within 1-5 minutes) make reporters feel heard, encouraging a "firehose" of continuous feedback.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Since we first released it... it's just been this firehose of feedback. ... In the early days, what I would do is anytime someone sends feedback, I would just go in and I would fix every single thing as fast as I possibly could... within a minute."
> "Now I kind of do the same thing but Claude honestly does a lot of the work. So I point it at the channel... I just put up a couple PRs, want to take a look at them? And I'm like, yeah."

### Productivity Metrics: 4x Output & 200% Efficiency Gains [03:34 - End]

**Summary**: The conversation shifts to the quantitative impact of these tools. The guest compares current gains to his time at Meta (Facebook/Instagram/WhatsApp).

**Key Points**:

- **Massive Gains**: The engineering team has "4x'd" their output.
- **Per-Engineer Metric**: Productivity per individual engineer has increased by **200%** (measured in pull requests).
- **Comparison to Big Tech**: At Meta, a win was a single-digit percentage increase in productivity. The current gains are "unprecedented."
- **Transfer Learning**: Training models on non-coding tasks (reasoning) has unexpectedly improved their coding abilities.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "We probably like 4x'd the engineering team... Productivity per engineer has increased 200% in terms of pull requests."
> "Back in a previous life I was at Meta... you would see a gain of like a few percentage points of productivity... Seeing these gains of just hundreds of percentage points, it's just absolutely insane."

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Lenny**: What's kind of the next frontier? So at this point, 100% of your code is being written by AI. This is clearly where everyone is going in software engineering. That felt like a crazy milestone. Now it's just like, of course, this is the world now. What's... what's kind of the next big shift to how software is written that either your team is already operating in or you think we'll head towards?

**[00:24]** **Guest**: I think something that's happening right now is Claude is starting to come up with ideas. Um, so Claude is looking through feedback, it's looking at bug reports, it's looking at, um, you know, like telemetry and things like this. And it's starting to come up with ideas for bug fixes and things to ship. So it's just starting to get a little more, um, you know, like a little more like a coworker or something like that.

**[00:50]** **Guest**: I think the second thing is we're starting to branch out of coding a little bit. So, I think at this point it's safe to say that coding is largely solved. At least for the kinds of programming that I do, it's just a solved problem because Claude can do it. And so now we're starting to think about, okay, like what's next? What's beyond this? There's a lot of things that are kind of adjacent to coding, um, and I think this is going to be coming.

**[01:13]** **Guest**: But also just, you know, general tasks. You know, like I use Claude every day now to do all sorts of things that are just not related to coding at all and just to do it automatically. Like for example, I had to pay a parking ticket the other day, I just had Claude do it. Um, all of my project management for the team, uh, Claude does all of it. It's like syncing stuff between spreadsheets and messaging people on Slack and email and all this kind of stuff.

**[01:37]** **Guest**: So I think the frontier is something like this. And I... I don't think it's coding because I think coding is, you know, it's pretty much solved. And over the next few months I think what we're going to see is just across the industry it's going to become increasingly solved. You know, for every kind of codebase, every tech stack that people work on.

**[01:53]** **Lenny**: This idea of helping you come up with what to work on is so interesting. A lot of people listening to this are product managers and, uh, they're probably sweating. How do you use Claude for this? Do you just talk to it? Is there anything clever you've come up with to help you use it to come up with what to build?

**[02:12]** **Guest**: Honestly, the simplest thing is like, open Claude Code or Co-work and point it at a Slack thread. Um, you know, like for us we have this channel that... that's all the internal feedback about Claude Code. Since we first released it, even in like 2024 internally, it's just been this firehose of feedback. Um, and it's the best.

**[02:32]** **Guest**: And like in the early days, what I would do is anytime that someone sends feedback, I would just go in and I would fix every single thing as fast as I possibly could. So like within a minute, within five minutes or whatever. And this just really fast feedback cycle, it encourages people to give more and more feedback. It's just so important because it makes them feel heard.

**[02:51]** **Guest**: Because, you know, like usually when you use a product, you give feedback, it just goes into a black hole somewhere and then you don't give feedback again. So if you make people feel heard, then they want to contribute and they want to help make the thing better. Um, and so now I kind of do the same thing, but Claude, honestly, does a lot of the work. So I point it at the channel and it's like, okay, here's a few things that I can do. I just put up a couple PRs, want to take a look at them? And I'm like, yeah.

**[03:13]** **Lenny**: Have you noticed that it is getting much better at this? Because this is kind of the holy grail. Right now it's like building... solved. Code review became kind of the next bottleneck, all these PRs, who's gonna review them all? The next big open question is just like, okay, now we need to... now humans are necessary for figuring out what to build, what to prioritize. And you're saying that that's where Claude Code is starting to help you. Is it... has it gotten a lot better with like say Opus 4.6 or... what's been the trajectory there?

**[03:43]** **Guest**: Yeah, yeah, it's improved a lot. Um, I think some of it is kind of like training that we do specific to coding. Um, so obviously, you know, best coding model in the world and, you know, it's getting better and better. Like 4.6 is just incredible. But also actually a lot of the training that we do outside of coding translates pretty well too. So there is this kind of like transfer where you teach the model to do, you know, X and it kind of gets better at Y.

**[04:09]** **Guest**: Um, yeah, and the gains have just been insane. Like at Anthropic, over the last year, like since we introduced Claude Code, we probably... I don't know the exact number, we probably like 4x'd the engineering team or something like this. But productivity *per engineer* has increased 200%. In terms of like pull requests. And like this number is just crazy for anyone that actually works in the space and works on dev productivity.

**[04:34]** **Guest**: Because back in a previous life I was at Meta and, you know, one of my responsibilities was code quality for the company. So this is like... all of our codebases... that was my responsibility, like Facebook, Instagram, WhatsApp. All this stuff. Um, and a lot of that was about productivity. Because if you make the code higher quality, then engineers are more productive.

**[04:54]** **Guest**: And things that we saw is, you know, in a year with hundreds of engineers working on it, you would see a gain of like a few percentage points of productivity. Something like this. Um, and so now we see these gains of just hundreds of percentage points. It's just absolutely insane.

**[05:11]** **Lenny**: What's also insane is just how normalized this has all been. Like we hear these numbers like, of course, AI is doing this to us. It's just... it's so unprecedented. The amount of change that is happening to software development, to building products. It's just this... the world of tech. It's just like so easy to get used to it. But it's important to recognize this.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **Coding is a "Solved" Problem**: For many standard software engineering tasks, AI models (like Claude) have reached a level of proficiency where the actual writing of code is no longer the primary challenge.
1. **The New Role of Engineers**: As coding becomes automated, the role of the engineer shifts to **Prioritization** (deciding what to build) and **Architecture/Orchestration** (managing AI agents that do the building and admin work).
1. **Feedback Velocity Drive Engagement**: The ability to fix bugs within minutes using AI encourages a "virtuous cycle" of internal feedback. When users see their feedback results in immediate code changes (PRs), they contribute significantly more.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Automate "Coworker" Tasks**: Don't just use AI for code. Use it for project management, syncing data between tools (Slack/Sheets), and administrative burdens.
- [ ] **Create an AI Feedback Loop**: Set up a channel for feedback and use an AI agent to monitor it, read the context, and automatically generate Pull Requests for fixes.
- [ ] **Shift Focus to "What," Not "How"**: If you are a PM or Engineer, start leveraging AI to analyze telemetry and bug reports to suggest *what* needs to be built next, rather than just using it to build what you already decided on.
