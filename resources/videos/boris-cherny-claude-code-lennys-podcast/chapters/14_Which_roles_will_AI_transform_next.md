## Executive Summary

In this interview segment, Lenny Rachitsky and Alex Albert discuss the rapidly evolving landscape of software engineering in the age of Artificial Intelligence. The conversation begins by identifying which roles will be impacted next by AI advancements. Albert argues that roles adjacent to engineering—such as Product Managers, Designers, and Data Scientists—are next in line for disruption as AI models become proficient at general computer work, not just code generation.

A central theme of the discussion is the definition and significance of "Agents." Albert clarifies that the term is often misused; technically, an agent is an Large Language Model (LLM) capable of using tools (e.g., editing files, running command-line instructions) rather than just conversing. This shift from "chatbot" to "agent" is what brings AI utility to non-technical knowledge work.

The dialogue moves to the economic implications of AI, specifically addressing **Jevons Paradox**—the idea that increasing efficiency might lead to increased consumption (hiring) rather than job loss. Albert confirms that Anthropic is actively hiring and notes that AI tools have made the act of coding "delightful" again by removing drudgery.

Finally, Albert offers a profound historical analogy, comparing the current AI revolution to the invention of the printing press. Just as the printing press democratized literacy and enabled the Renaissance (leading to unpredictable second-order effects like modern science and the internet), Albert believes democratizing the ability to program software will unlock a future that is currently unimaginable, though he acknowledges the transition will be socially disruptive and requires careful policy consideration.

## Detailed Content

### The Changing Landscape & The Next Roles Impacted [00:00 - 00:40]

**Summary**: Lenny observes that the daily life of a software engineer has fundamentally changed over the last year. He asks Alex which roles within or outside of tech will be impacted next by AI.

**Key Points**:

- Software engineering has already undergone a dramatic shift.
- The next roles to be impacted are those **adjacent to engineering**.
- Specific roles mentioned: Product Managers, Designers, and Data Scientists.
- AI models are improving at general computer work, extending their reach beyond just code syntax.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> **Lenny:** "What do you think is the next role that will be most impacted by AI within... tech... or even outside tech?"
> **Alex:** "I think it's going to be a lot of the roles that are adjacent to engineering. So yeah, it could be like product managers, it could be design, could be data science... It is going to expand to pretty much any kind of work that you can do on a computer."

  - Text on screen: No text overlays.

### Defining "AI Agents" [00:40 - 01:52]

**Summary**: Alex explains that while "agent" is a buzzword, it has a specific technical meaning: an LLM that can use tools. He distinguishes this from the conversational AI (chatbots) most people are used to.

**Key Points**:

- The "Claude Code" product is the first step toward agentic workflows.
- **Definition of Agent**: An AI/LLM that doesn't just talk, but acts. It can interact with systems.
- **Capabilities**: Using Google Docs, sending emails, running terminal commands, editing files.
- Current public perception of AI is limited to "conversational" bots; "agentic" AI is the next phase.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> **Alex:** "This word 'agent' just gets thrown around all the time... But agent actually has like a very specific technical meaning... it's a AI, it's a LLM that's able to use tools. So it doesn't just talk, it can actually act and it can interact with your system."

### Social Responsibility & Policy [01:52 - 02:18]

**Summary**: Alex emphasizes the urgency of handling this transition responsibly. He mentions Anthropic's commitment to understanding the societal impact through economists and policy experts.

**Key Points**:

- The shift to agentic AI is urgent and significant.
- Anthropic employs economists, policy folks, and social impact teams.
- The industry and society must figure out how to manage the disruption together; it shouldn't be up to tech companies alone.

### Jevons Paradox & The Joy of Coding [02:18 - 03:13]

**Summary**: Lenny asks about job losses versus Jevons Paradox (efficiency leading to more demand). Alex confirms his team is still hiring and pivots to the *experience* of work, noting that AI has made coding fun again by removing tedious tasks.

**Key Points**:

- **Hiring Status**: Anthropic's Claude Code team is actively hiring.
- **Personal Experience**: Alex enjoys coding now more than ever because the "minutiae" is handled by AI.
- **Customer Feedback**: Users report that tools like Claude Code make coding "delightful again."

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> **Lenny:** "There's this concept of Jevons paradox... as we can do more, we hire more... are you hiring more than if you didn't have AI?"
> **Alex:** "For our team we're we're hiring... Personally, it's... all this stuff has just made me enjoy my work more... I have never enjoyed coding as much as I do today because I don't have to deal with all the minutiae."

### The Printing Press Analogy [03:13 - 04:41]

**Summary**: To predict the future, Alex looks to the past, specifically the invention of the printing press. He argues that democratizing access to a skill (literacy then, coding now) leads to an explosion of innovation that is impossible to predict from the pre-democratization vantage point.

**Key Points**:

- **Historical Analog**: The Printing Press unlocked literacy, which was previously restricted to a small elite.
- **Democratization Effect**: Widespread literacy enabled the Renaissance, science, and eventually the internet.
- **Unpredictability**: A person in the 1400s could not have predicted microphones or the internet as a result of the printing press.
- **Future Vision**: A world where *everyone* can program software will unlock unpredictable innovations.
- **Warning**: The transition will be disruptive and painful for some, requiring societal dialogue.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> **Alex:** "I think the printing press is just such a good one... this technology that was locked away to a small set of people... became accessible to everyone... If that wasn't the case, then something like the Renaissance just could never have happened."
> **Alex:** "I imagine a world... where everyone is able to program. And what does that unlock? Anyone can just build software anytime. And I have no idea. It's just the same way that, you know, in the 1400s no one could have predicted this."

## Full Transcript

**[00:00]** **Lenny:** ...actually have to know all the details. Clearly, the life of a software engineer has changed dramatically. It's like a whole new job now as of the past year or two. What do you think is the next role that will be most impacted by AI within... either within tech, like, you know, product managers, designers, or even outside tech? Just like, what do you think? Where do you think AI is going next?

**[00:23]** **Alex:** I think it's going to be a lot of the roles that are adjacent to engineering. Um, so yeah, it could be like product managers, it could be design, could be data science. It is going to expand to pretty much any kind of work that you can do on a computer because the model is just going to get better and better at this. Um, and you know like this is—the Claude Code product is kind of the first way to get at this. But it's just the first one.

**[00:44]** **Alex:** And it's the thing that I think brings AI, agentic AI, to people that haven't really used it before. And people are starting just to—to get a sense of it for the first time. When I think back to engineering a year ago, no one really knew what an agent was. No one really used it. But nowadays it's just the way that, you know, we do our work.

**[00:58]** **Alex:** And then when I look at non-technical work today, um, so you know like—or like maybe semi-technical, like product work and, you know, like data science and things like this. When you look at the kinds of AI that people are using, it's always—it's always these like conversational AI. It's like a chatbot or whatever. But no one really has used an agent before.

**[01:21]** **Alex:** And this word "agent" just gets thrown around all the time and it's just like so misused. It's like lost all meaning. But "agent" actually has like a very specific technical meaning. Which is: it's a AI, it's a LLM that's able to use tools. So it doesn't just talk. It can actually act and it can interact with your system.

**[01:39]** **Alex:** And, you know, this means like it can use your Google Docs and it can send email. It can run commands on your computer and do all this kind of stuff. So I think like any kind of job where you do—you use computer tools in this way, I think this is going to be next.

**[01:53]** **Alex:** This is something we have to kind of figure out as a society. This is something we have to figure out as an industry. Um, and I think for me also this is one of the reasons it—it feels very important and urgent to do this work at Anthropic. Because I think we take this very, very seriously. Um, and so now, you know, we have economists, we have uh policy folks, we have social impact folks. This is something we just want to talk about a lot so as society we can kind of figure out what to do. Because it shouldn't be up to us.

**[02:18]** **Lenny:** So the big question, which you're kind of alluding to, is jobs and job loss and things like that. There's this concept of Jevons paradox... of just as we can do more, we hire more and it's not actually as scary as it looks. What have you experienced so far, I guess, with AI becoming a big part of the engineering job? Just are you hiring more than if you didn't have AI? And just thoughts on jobs?

**[02:41]** **Alex:** Yeah, I mean for our team we're—we're hiring. Um, so Claude Code team is hiring. Um, if you're interested just check out the jobs page on—on Anthropic. Personally, it's, you know—all this stuff has just made me enjoy my work more. I have never enjoyed coding as much as I do today. Because I don't have to deal with all the minutiae.

**[03:00]** **Alex:** So for me personally it's been quite exciting. This is something that we hear from a lot of customers. Where they love the tool. They love Claude Code because it just makes coding delightful again. Uh, and that's just—that's just so fun for them. But it's hard to know where this thing is going to go.

**[03:14]** **Alex:** And again I just like—I have to reach for these historical analogs. Uh, and I think the printing press is just such a good one. Because what happened is this technology that was locked away to a small set of people, like knowing how to read and write, became accessible to everyone. It was just inherently democratizing. Everyone started to be able to do this.

**[03:36]** **Alex:** And if that wasn't the case, then something like the Renaissance just could never have happened. Because a lot of the Renaissance, it was about like knowledge spreading. It was about like written records that people used to communicate. Um, you know cause there were no phones or anything like this. There wasn't—there was no internet at the time.

**[03:54]** **Alex:** So it's—it's about like, what does this enable next? I think that's the very optimistic version of it for me and that's the part that I'm really excited about. It's just unimaginable. You know like, we couldn't be talking today if the printing press hadn't been invented. Like our microphones wouldn't exist. None of the things around us would exist. It just wouldn't be possible to coordinate such a large group of people if that wasn't the case.

**[04:16]** **Alex:** And so I imagine a world, you know, a few years in the future where everyone is able to program. And what does that unlock? Anyone can just build software anytime. And I have no idea. It's just the same way that, you know, in the 1400s no one could have predicted this. Um, I think it's the same way. But I do think in the meantime it's going to be very disruptive. And it's going to be painful for a lot of people. Um, and you know again, as a society, this is a conversation that we have to have. And this is a thing that we have to figure out.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **Shift from Chat to Action:** The era of AI is moving from "Chatbots" (conversational) to "Agents" (tool-using). This capability allows LLMs to interact with file systems, emails, and terminals to perform actual work.
1. **Expansion of Impact:** The disruption seen in software engineering is about to spread to adjacent fields. Product Managers, Designers, and Data Scientists—essentially anyone whose primary output involves computer tools—are next.
1. **The "Joy" of AI:** Contrary to the narrative of AI taking the "fun" out of human creativity, current feedback suggests AI removes the tedious "minutiae" of coding, making the process more delightful and enabling engineers to focus on higher-level problem solving.
1. **The Democratization of Code:** We are in a "Printing Press Moment" for software. Just as widespread literacy fueled the Renaissance and modern science, widespread ability to create software (via AI) will likely lead to innovations we cannot currently conceive.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Explore Agentic Workflows:** If you are a knowledge worker (PM, Data Scientist), start investigating how AI agents can interact with your tools, not just how chatbots can answer questions.
- [ ] **Check Anthropic Careers:** The Claude Code team is actively hiring, suggesting that AI companies are expanding, not shrinking, their human workforce.
- [ ] **Engage in Policy Discussions:** Recognize that the transition to AI-driven work will be socially disruptive. Participate in or support societal conversations about how to manage this transition, as it cannot be solved by tech companies alone.
