## Detailed Content

### Closing Thoughts on Anthropic's Strategy [1:14:02 - 1:16:18]

**Summary**: Boris summarizes Anthropic's development philosophy and the unexpected scale of "Claude Code."

**Key Points**:

- Anthropic’s core thesis: Start at coding -> get to tool use -> get to computer use.
- This progression is how they build models and study safety.
- "Claude Code" has grown into a multi-billion dollar business, which was a surprise as it started as a simple terminal tool.
- Despite the massive revenue numbers (Lenny mentions $2B for Claude Code and $15B for Anthropic), Boris feels the industry is only "1% done."

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "For Anthropic since the beginning, this idea of starting at coding, then getting to tool use, then getting to computer use has just been the way that we think about things... In some ways it's a total surprise... but in some ways it's just totally unsurprising because this has been our belief as a company for a long time."

### Lightning Round: Book Recommendations [1:16:18 - 1:19:57]

**Summary**: Boris provides technical and sci-fi book recommendations that influence his thinking.

**Key Points**:

- **Technical**: *Functional Programming in Scala*. Boris calls it the best technical book he's ever read due to its elegance in teaching functional programming and thinking in types.
- **Sci-Fi**: *Accelerando* by Charles Stross. Fast-paced, captures the essence of the current AI moment and the approach toward singularity.
- **Sci-Fi**: *The Wandering Earth* (Short Stories) by Cixin Liu. Offers a unique Chinese perspective on sci-fi compared to Western tropes.
- **Sci-Fi**: *A Fire Upon the Deep* and *A Deepness in the Sky* by Vernor Vinge (Recommended by both Lenny and Boris).

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Accelerando... I just feel like it captures the essence of this moment that we're in more than any other book that I've read, just the speed of it. It starts just as liftoff is starting to happen... and it ends with like this collective lobster consciousness orbiting Jupiter."

**Visual Content**:

  - Description: An illustrated graphic appears over the video with a campfire and marshmallows.
  - Text on screen: "Lightning Round"

### Favorite Product: Cowork [1:20:19 - 1:24:10]

**Summary**: Boris introduces "Cowork," an internal tool/product within the Claude ecosystem that functions as an autonomous agent.

**Key Points**:

- **Chrome Integration**: The tool can control the browser to perform tasks.
- **Use Cases**:
  - Paying traffic fines.
  - Canceling subscriptions.
  - **Project Management**: Boris uses it to manage the team status spreadsheet. It autonomously messages engineers on Slack who haven't updated their status.
  - **Parallel Processing**: You can spin up multiple "Claudes" to do different tasks (email, spreadsheets) simultaneously while you step away.
- It passed an internal evaluation by completing 48 out of 50 non-technical use cases suggested by a blog post written by Lenny.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "I'm gonna shill a little bit and just say Cowork... It paid a traffic fine for me, it canceled a couple subscriptions for me... I use it for all my project management... every Monday Cowork just goes through and it messages every engineer on Slack that hasn't filled out their status."

### Life Motto & Twitter Strategy [1:24:10 - 1:27:43]

**Summary**: Boris shares his core advice for work and explains his direct engagement style on social media.

**Key Points**:

- **Motto**: "Use Common Sense." Many failures in work environments come from following processes blindly or working on bad ideas without applying first-principles thinking.
- **Twitter/X**: Boris became active on Twitter out of boredom during a vacation in Europe. He started fixing bugs reported by users in real-time.
- **Engagement**: He values the direct feedback loop. If a user reports a bug, he can often fix it within minutes, which surprises and delights users.

**Transcript Excerpt**:

> "Use common sense. I think a lot of the failures that I see especially in a work environment is people just failing to use common sense... they follow a process without thinking about it."

## Full Transcript

**[1:14:02]** **Boris**: Amazing.
**Lenny**: Boris, this was incredible. I feel like we're... we're brothers now from Ukraine. Before we get to our very exciting lightning round, is there anything else that you wanted to share? Is there anything you want to leave listeners with? Anything you want... uh... you want to double down on?

**[1:14:18]** **Boris**: Yeah, I think I would just like underscore, you know, like for Anthropic since the beginning, this idea of starting at coding, then getting to tool use, then getting to computer use has just been the way that we think about things. And we... this is the way that we know the models are going to develop or, you know, the way that we want to build our models. And it's also the way that we get to learn about safety, study it, and improve it the most.

**[1:14:41]** **Boris**: So, you know, everything that's happening right now around, you know, just like Claude Code becoming this huge, you know, multi-billion dollar business. And, you know, like now all of my friends use Claude Code and they just text me about it all the time. Uh, so just like, you know, this thing getting kind of big. In some ways, it's a total surprise because this isn't kind of the... we didn't know that it would be this product. We didn't know that it would start in a terminal or anything like this.

**[1:15:05]** **Boris**: But in some ways, it's just totally unsurprising because this has been our belief as a company for a long time. At the same time, it just feels still very early. You know, like most of the world still does not use Claude Code. Most of the world still does not use AI. So it just feels like this is 1% done and there is so much more to go.

**[1:15:21]** **Lenny**: Oh man. That's insane to think seeing the numbers that are coming out. You guys just raised a bazillion dollars. Uh, I think Claude Code alone is making two billion dollars in revenue. You think Anthropic... I think the number you guys put out, you're making 15 billion in revenue. It's... uh... insane to just think this is... how early it still is and just the numbers we're seeing.

**[1:15:42]** **Boris**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's crazy. And I mean like the way that Claude Code has kept growing is honestly just the users. Like we... so many people use it, they're so passionate about it. They fell in love with the product. And then they tell us about stuff that doesn't work, stuff that they want. And so like the only reason that it keeps improving is because everyone is using it. Everyone is talking about it. Everyone keeps giving feedback. And this is just the single most important thing. And, you know, for me, this is the way that I love to spend my day is just talking to users and making it better for them.

**[1:16:09]** **Lenny**: And making miso.
**Boris**: And making miso. Well, the... you know, the miso is like not super involved. It just... you just gotta wait.
**Lenny**: You just gotta wait.

**[1:16:18]** **Lenny**: Well, Boris, with that, we've reached our very exciting lightning round. I've got five questions for you. Are you ready?
**Boris**: Let's do it.

**[1:16:25]** **Lenny**: First question. What are two or three books that you find yourself recommending most to other people?

**[1:16:29]** **Boris**: I... I'm a big reader. Uh, I would start with a technical book. One is... it is *Functional Programming in Scala*. This is the single best technical book I've ever read. It's very weird because you're probably not going to use Scala and I don't know how much this matters in the future now. But there's this just elegance to functional programming and thinking in types and this is just the way that I code and the way that I can't stop thinking about coding.

**[1:16:51]** **Lenny**: So, you know, you could think of it as a historical artifact. You could think of it as something that will level you up.
**Lenny**: I love this. Never before mentioned book. My favorite.
**Boris**: Oh, amazing. Amazing.

**[1:17:01]** **Boris**: Uh, okay. Second one is *Accelerando* by Stross. This is probably, you know, like my... my big genre is uh... is Sci-Fi. Uh, like probably Sci-Fi and fiction. *Accelerando* is just this incredible book and it... it represents just so fast-paced. The pace gets faster and faster and faster. And I just feel like it captures the essence of this moment that we're in more than any other book that I've read. Just the speed of it.

**[1:17:23]** **Boris**: And it starts just as liftoff is starting to happen and, you know, starting to approach the singularity. And it ends with like this collective lobster consciousness orbiting Jupiter. Um, and, you know, this happens over like the span of a few decades or something. So the pace is just incredible. I really love it.

**[1:17:41]** **Boris**: Maybe I'll do one more book. Uh, *The Wandering Earth*. Uh, *Wandering Earth* by Cixin Liu. So he's the guy that did *Three Body Problem*. I think a lot of people know him for that. I actually think *Three Body Problem* is awesome, but I actually liked his short stories even more. So *Wandering Earth* is one of the short story collections and it just has some really, really amazing stories.

**[1:18:01]** **Boris**: And it's also just quite interesting to see uh... Chinese Sci-Fi because it has a very different perspective than Western Sci-Fi and kind of the way that um... at least he as a writer thinks about it. So it's just really, really interesting to read and just beautifully written.

**[1:18:15]** **Lenny**: It's so interesting how Sci-Fi has prepared us to think about where things are going. Just like... it creates these mental models of like, okay, I see, I've read about this sort of world.

**[1:18:24]** **Boris**: Yeah. I think... I think for me this is like the reason that I joined Anthropic actually. Because uh... you know, like I said, I was living in this rural place. I was thinking these long time scales because everything is just so slow out there. At least compared to SF. Um, and just like all the things that you do are based around the seasons and it's based around this food that takes many, many months. That's the way that kind of social events were organized. That's the way you kind of organize your time.

**[1:18:48]** **Boris**: You like... you go to the farmer's market and it's like, it's persimmon season. And you know that because there's like 20 persimmon vendors. And then the next week the season is done and it's like grape season and you kind of see this. So it's like these kind of long time scales. And I was also reading a bunch of Sci-Fi at the time. And just like being in this moment I was like, you know, just thinking about these long time scales. I know how this thing can go. And I just... I felt like I had to contribute to it going a little bit better. And that's actually why I ended up at Ant[hropic] and Ben Mann was also a big part of that too.

**[1:19:17]** **Lenny**: I feel like I want to do a whole podcast just talking about your time in Japan and the journey of Boris through Japan to Anthropic. But we'll keep it... we'll keep it short. Uh, I'll quickly recommend a Sci-Fi book to you if you haven't read it. Have you read *A Fire Upon the Deep*?
**Boris**: Uh... This is Vinge, right? Yes.
**Lenny**: Yes. Okay. That one's like... it's like so interesting from an AI/AGI perspective. Uh... so few people have read that so um...
**Boris**: I really liked *Deepness in the Sky* also. I think it was part of the...
**Lenny**: Which is the sequel right? Or... Yeah.
**Boris**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. I think so.
**Lenny**: Yeah. It's very long and like complex to get into but so good.

**[1:19:57]** **Lenny**: Okay. We'll keep going through our lightning round. Uh, do you have a favorite recent movie or TV show you really enjoyed?

**[1:19:59]** **Boris**: So I actually don't really watch TV or movies. I just don't really have time these days. Um, I did watch... I'm gonna bring up another Cixin Liu, but the *Three Body Problem* series on Netflix. I really loved. Um, I thought that was like a great rendition of the book series.

**[1:20:13]** **Lenny**: This is a common pattern across uh... AI leaders is no time to watch TV or movies which I completely understand. Uh, is there a favorite product you've recently discovered that you really love?

**[1:20:19]** **Boris**: I'm gonna like shill a little bit and just say Cowork. Because... this is legitimately the one product that's been pretty life-changing for me. Uh, just cause I... I have it running all the time. And uh... the Chrome integration in particular is just really excellent. Uh, so it's been like... it paid a traffic fine for me, it canceled a couple subscriptions for me. Uh, just like the amount of like tedious work it gets out of the way is awesome.

**[1:20:45]** **Boris**: I also don't know if it's a product but maybe I'll also... another podcast that I really love, obviously besides uh... besides Lenny is uh... it's the *Acquired* podcast by Ben and David. It's just like super... it's super awesome. Um, I feel like the way that they get into like business history and bring it alive is... is really, really good. And I would start with the Nintendo episode if uh... if you haven't listened to it.

**[1:21:09]** **Lenny**: Great tip. Uh, with Cowork just so people understand if they haven't tried this... like basically you type something you want to get done and it can launch Chrome and just do things for you. I saw one of the... someone went on Pat leave from Anthropic and he had it fill out these like medical forms for him. These like really annoying PDFs where it just like loads up the browser, logs in, fills them out, submits them.

**[1:21:30]** **Boris**: Yeah, exactly, exactly. And it actually just kind of works. Like we tried this experiment like a year ago and it didn't really work because the model wasn't ready. But now... now it actually just works and it's amazing. I think a lot of people just don't really understand what this is because they haven't used an agent before. And it just feels very, very similar to me to Claude Code a year ago. Um, but like I said, it's just growing much faster than Claude Code did in the early days. So I think it's starting to... it's starting to break through a bit.

**[1:21:55]** **Lenny**: And there's also this Chrome extension that you mentioned that you could just use standalone that sits in Chrome and you could just talk to Claude uh... looking at your screen, at your browser and have it do stuff. Have it tell you about what you're looking at, summarize what you're looking at, things like that.

**[1:22:08]** **Boris**: Exactly, exactly. For people that are like just starting to use Cowork, the thing I recommend is... so you download the Claude Desktop app. You go to the Cowork tab. It's right next to the Code tab. Um, the thing that I recommend doing is like, start by having it use a tool. So like clean up your desktop or like summarize your email or something like this. Or, you know, like respond to the top three emails. Like it actually just responds to emails for me now too.

**[1:22:29]** **Boris**: The second thing is connect tools. So like if you connect like... if you say look at my top emails and then send Slack messages or you know like put them in a spreadsheet or something. Or for example like I use it for all my project management. So we have a single spreadsheet for the whole team. There's like a row for engineer. Every week everyone fills out a status. And every Monday Cowork just goes through and it messages every engineer on Slack that hasn't filled out their status. And so I don't have to do this anymore. And this is just one prompt. It will do everything.

**[1:22:56]** **Boris**: And then the third thing is just run a bunch of Claudes in parallel. So like in Cowork you can have as many tasks running as you want. So it's like start one task, you know I have this project management thing running. Then I'll have it do something else, then something else. And I'll kick these off and then I just go get a coffee while it runs.

**[1:23:09]** **Lenny**: There's a post I'll link to that shares a bunch of ways people use uh... what was previously Claude Code and now just you could do through Cowork. Because a lot of this is just like, wow, I hadn't thought I could use it for that. And once you see these examples I think are what people need to hear. I'm just like, oh, wow. I didn't know I could do that.

**[1:23:26]** **Boris**: Yeah. I think a lot of this was also... some of this was also inspired by you, Lenny. You had this post about uh... it was like 50 non-technical use cases for Claude Code or something like this. So we actually... one of our PMs used that as a way to evaluate Cowork before we released it. Um, and I think at the point where we hit... where Cowork was able to do like 48 out of the 50, they were like, okay, it's pretty good.

**[1:23:46]** **Lenny**: Wow. I did not know that. That is awesome. Uh... I've become an eval.
**Boris**: Yeah. How does that feel?
**Lenny**: Amazing. I feel like I'm valuable to the future of AI.
**Boris**: This is like reverse breaking through.

**[1:24:08]** **Lenny**: Wow. That is so cool. Wow. Okay. I wonder what those last two are. Anyway, okay, two more questions. Um, do you have a favorite life motto that you often come back to in work or in life?

**[1:24:14]** **Boris**: Use common sense. I think a lot of the failures that I see in... especially in a work environment is people just failing to use common sense. Like they follow a process without thinking about it. Um, they just do a thing without thinking about it. Or they're working on a product that's like not a good product or not a good idea. And they're just following the momentum and not thinking about it. I think the best results that I see are people thinking from first principles and just developing their own common sense. Like if something smells weird then, you know, it's probably not a good idea. So I think just this. This is the single advice that I give, you know, to coworkers more... more than anything too.

**[1:24:46]** **Lenny**: I feel like that alone could be its own podcast conversation. What is common sense? How do you build it? But we'll keep this short. Uh, final question. Uh, so you've been... got more active on Twitter/X. I'm curious just uh... why? And just what's your experience been with... with Twitter, the world of Twitter? Uh, because you get a lot of engagement on... on Twitter/X.

**[1:25:06]** **Boris**: So for a long time I used Threads exclusively because I actually helped build Threads a little bit back in the day. Um, and I also just like the design. It's like a very clean product. Uh, I just really liked that. I started using Threads because actually I was bored. Um, so in... in December I was in Europe. Uh...
**Lenny**: Started using Twitter you mean?
**Boris**: Oh yeah, yeah, yeah. I started using uh Twitter because I was bored. So my wife and I were uh... we were traveling around in... in Europe for December. We were just kind of nomading around. We went to like Copenhagen, went to like a few different countries. Um, and for me it was just like a coding vacation. So every day I was coding and that's like my favorite kind of vacation. Just... just like code all day. It's the best.

**[1:25:43]** **Boris**: And at some point I just kind of got bored and like I ran out of ideas for, you know, like a few hours. I was like, okay, what do I want to do next? And so I opened Twitter. I saw some people like tweeting about Claude Code and then I just started responding. And then I was like, okay, maybe actually a thing I should do is just like look for people... look for bugs that people have. Maybe people have like bugs or kind of feedback they have. And so kind of introduce myself, ask for it. People had a bunch of bugs and feedback.

**[1:26:08]** **Boris**: And I think they were kind of surprised by like the pace at which we're able to address feedback nowadays. Um, for me it's just like so normal like if someone has a bug like I can probably fix it within a few minutes because I just start a Claude and as long as the description is good it will just go and do it. And then I'll... I'll go do something else and answer the next thing. But I think for a lot of people it was pretty surprising. So that was really cool. And yeah the experience on Twitter has been pretty great. It's... it's been awesome just engaging with people and seeing what people want. Uh, hearing... hearing about bugs, hearing about features.

**[1:26:38]** **Lenny**: I saw you uh... complained to Nikita Bier the other day on Twitter. Just you... you're like posting many threads and it was breaking and just like, oh man, what's going on here?
**Boris**: Yeah, yeah, yeah. There... there was a bug. I hope it's fixed now.
**Lenny**: Amazing. Oh man, Boris, I could chat with you for hours. Uh, I'll let you go. Uh, thank you so much for doing this. Uh, you are wonderful. Um, where can folks find you online? How can listeners be useful to you?

**[1:27:00]** **Boris**: Yeah, find me on Threads or on Twitter. That's the... that's the easiest place. And please just tag me on stuff. Um, send bugs, send feature requests. What's missing? What can we do to make the products better? What do you... like what do you want? Um, I... I love, love hearing it.
**Lenny**: Amazing. Boris, thank you so much for being here.
**Boris**: Cool. Thanks Lenny.
**Lenny**: Bye everyone.

## Key Takeaways

### Main Lessons

1. **The Engineering Strategy of Anthropic**: The company follows a deliberate linear progression: master **Coding** -> master **Tool Use** -> master **Computer Use**. This framework guides their product roadmap and safety research.
1. **The Power of AI Agents (Cowork)**: We are moving past simple chat interfaces. Agents like "Cowork" can perform end-to-end administrative tasks (canceling subscriptions, managing project spreadsheets, responding to emails) by controlling the browser.
1. **Speed of Development**: Modern AI-assisted engineering allows for near-instant bug fixing. Boris mentions fixing user-reported bugs within minutes by spinning up a Claude instance, changing the expectation of feedback loops.

### Actionable Advice

- [ ] **Read "Functional Programming in Scala"**: Even if you don't use the language, it teaches a superior way of thinking about code and types.
- [ ] **Try "Cowork" in Claude**: Download the Claude Desktop app, go to the Cowork tab, and assign it a real-world task like "clean up my desktop" or "summarize my emails."
- [ ] **Use First Principles**: Don't follow workplace processes blindly. Apply common sense to every product decision and workflow.

> "For Anthropic since the beginning, this idea of starting at coding, then getting to tool use, then getting to computer use has just been the way that we think about things." - **Boris**

> "Accelerando... captures the essence of this moment that we're in more than any other book... it starts just as liftoff is starting to happen." - **Boris**

> "Use common sense. I think a lot of the failures that I see especially in a work environment is people just failing to use common sense... they follow a process without thinking about it." - **Boris**
